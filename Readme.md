## Face Recognition API

The backend node server for the face recognition API

Receives requests from the front end
Uses the clarifai API for face recognition
Deployed to Heroku servers services (free trial)

# Demo of the website (WIP!!!)

https://desu-facerec-app.herokuapp.com/
Please give it a minute to load or something. I'm using a free trial so the server may take a bit to start it up!
Please also keep in mind this is a work in progress. Some security features may not be implemented yet.
